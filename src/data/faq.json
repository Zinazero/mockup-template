    "question": "What am I getting myself into?",
    "answer": "An escape room is an activity where you are placed in a room and have to solve a series of puzzles to make your way through the room (or series of rooms) and out the exit door within 60 minutes. They're are an amazingly fun time! None of our escape rooms are scary and we employ no live actors or have any jump scares. The door you enter through will never lock behind you and you are never restrained in the room, BUT you will have to use your brain power!"

    "question": "What is the cost and how can I pay?",

  {
    "question": "How old do I have to be to play?",
    "answer": "Escape rooms are great for any age, but we recommend you be at least 6 years old to participate with an adult present. For anyone under 14, we require a parent or guardian present in the building. For those 14 and older, no parent or guardian is required."

  {
    "question": "Can’t I just stop by and play?",
    "answer": "You can absolutely try ... but we might be booked up! Your best bet is to click the 'Book Now' button and get yourself scheduled in! Then your spot is guaranteed! You can also call or email to see if we have any openings. "

    "question": "How can I book?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What if I need to cancel after I book?",

    "question": "Is your location accessible for those with disabilities?",

    "question": "Do you have any rage rooms?",
